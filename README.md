# Zybo Open Source Video IP Toolbox

This started out as a simple demonstration of what was possible with the video interfaces on a Zybo FPGA, but has since evolved into the backbone of my Masters Thesis.

This repository contains IP cores meant to be used in Vivado. The VHDL source files are surely usable in other tools, but I do not actively provide support for that workflow.

## Vivado on Windows

If you are using Vivado, you may want to clone this repo closer to the root of your drive. I use `C:\ZyboIP`. Windows has issues with long paths, and Vivado will exhibit unusual behavior if the paths exceed the character limit.
